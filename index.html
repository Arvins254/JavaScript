    <p>HTML is Hypertext Markup Language.
    Hypertext defines the links between pages while Markup defines the text document within the tag in the structure of the web.
     HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.
      Here is the year in which HTML versions were published.
