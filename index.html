    <h1>Learning Html</h1>
    <p>HTML is Hypertext Markup Language.
    Hypertext defines the links between pages while Markup defines the text document within the tag in the structure of the web.
     <br>HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.
      Here is the year in which HTML versions were published.<br>

    <h2>HTML PAGE STRUCTURE</h2>
    <p>HTML Structure is major constituted of <strong>tags</strong> and <strong>elements</strong> which tell the browser how to properly display the content in the HTML file. <em>Remeber to always use closing at the end of each tag used, this will prevent the browser from defaulting all the following content into one tag that was preciously used.</em><br>
      Basic structure of an HTML page looks like this.<br>
